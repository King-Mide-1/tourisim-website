      <p>Angkor Wat is spread across over 400 acres / 1.6 km², and is said to be the largest religious monument in the world. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992, which encouraged an international effort to save the complex.</p>

      <img src="Angkor-Wat3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Since around 1850, Angkor Wat has been featured in the center of the national flag of Cambodia, as if to show their incredible pride in the ancient monument. Their pride is also reflected by putting images from Angkor Wat on many denominations of the riel (Cambodia's currency).</p>
    </section><br>
    <section class="four">
      <img src="angkor_wat2.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Unlike most Angkorian temples which are commonly directed to the east, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west, a direction associated with death in Hindu culture. So, many archaeologists and scholars have concluded that Suryavarman intended to use it as a funerary temple.

        Also, the direction means it faces the sunset, which adds to its beauty and attracts many visitors at this time.

    <p>At 6.9 million square kilometers (2.72 million square miles), the Amazon Basin is roughly the size of the forty-eight contiguous United States and covers some 40 percent of the South American continent. The "Amazon rainforest" — which defined biogeographically includes the rainforest in the Guianas, which technically are outside the Amazon Basin — covers 7.8-8.2 million square km (3-3.2 million square mi), of which just over 80 percent is forested.</p>

    <p>The Amazon River is by far the world's largest river by volume, carrying more than five times the volume of the Congo or twelve times that of the Mississippi.

      <h4>Muyuna Amazon Lodge</h4>
      <span>Muyuna Amazon Lodge is an Ecolodge which enables you to enjoy a pleasant stay in the middle of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest where we combine a good service and the satisfaction to observe wildlife in their own habitat.
        We are located far from the city, 140kms upriver from Iquitos (about 3 hours by speed boat) by the Amazon River, inside the reserve Tamshiyacu - Tahuayo. That makes us feel keen to guarantee the observation of birds, monkeys, sloth, pink dolphins, piranhas, caimans, etc., in their own habitat.
